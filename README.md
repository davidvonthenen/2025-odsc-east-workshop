# 2025 ODSC Workshop: Adaptive RAG Systems with Knowledge Graphs: Building Reinforcement-Learning-Driven AI Applications

Welcome to landing page for workshop `Adaptive RAG Systems with Knowledge Graphs: Building Reinforcement-Learning-Driven AI Applications` at `2025 Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) East`.

## What to Expect

This workshop intends to provide an introduction to:

- Build a naively simple Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent using LLM-generated Cyphers
- Build a useful Graph-based RAG Agent using Fixed-Logic Cyphers
- (Optional) Introduction to using [Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) to connect multiple agents together
- (Optional) Build a simple Vector-based

All of this can be done without requiring GPU resources or lengthy training times because:

- Graph Databases don't (typiclally) require GPUs!
- **IMPORTANT** The training dataset is intentionally small for the purposes of this workshop

## Participation Options

There are 2 options available to participate in this workshop:

## Option 1: The Easy Way to Participate

If you are just looking to dip your toe into learning about RAG Agents, we will offer several [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/) where you will be able to participate in the workshop without requiring any prerequisites software or configuration. You just need a laptop and a browser.

If you choose this option, click [COLAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/davidvonthenen/2025-odsc-east-workshop/tree/main/COLAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Option 2: A Full Production-like Experience

If you opt for the full experience, you need to have a Linux/MacOS based operating system. Should have already installed the software components in the pre-workshop instructions. 

If you haven't setup anything yet and still want to go with this option, the link below will have the all required software you need to install.
