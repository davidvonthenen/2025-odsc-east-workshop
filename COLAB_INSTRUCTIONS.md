# INSTRUCTIONS: Using Google Colab

If you opt for the [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/) experience, upload the 2 Jupyter Notebooks found below to Colab:

- [BuildingGraphRAGAgents_Part1.ipynb](https://github.com/davidvonthenen/2025-odsc-east-workshop/tree/main/JUPYTER/BuildingGraphRAGAgents_Part1.ipynb)
- [BuildingGraphRAGAgents_Part2.ipynb](https://github.com/davidvonthenen/2025-odsc-east-workshop/tree/main/JUPYTER/BuildingGraphRAGAgents_Part2.ipynb)

OR

An alternate way to do this is, upload to your Google Drive and once uploaded, double click each Notebook to automatically open in Colab.

## Prerequisites

The default compute type should be `T4`. If `CPU` is selected, in the upper right hand side next to `Connect`/`Reconnect`, there is a drop down to change the compute type. Please select `T4`.
